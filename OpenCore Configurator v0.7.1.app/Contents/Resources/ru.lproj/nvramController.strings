Some of the known boot arguments include:\n– acpi_layer=0xFFFFFFFF\n– acpi_level=0xFFFF5F (implies ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS)\n– arch=i386 (force kernel architecture to i386, see KernelArch)\n– batman=VALUE (AppleSmartBatteryManager debug mask)\n– batman-nosmc=1 (disable AppleSmartBatteryManager SMC interface)\n– cpus=VALUE (maximum number of CPUs used)\n– debug=VALUE (debug mask)\n– io=VALUE (IOKit debug mask)\n– keepsyms=1 (show panic log debug symbols)\n– kextlog=VALUE (kernel extension loading debug mask)\n– nvram-log=1 (enables AppleEFINVRAM logs)\n– nv_disable=1 (disables NVIDIA GPU acceleration)\n– nvda_drv=1 (legacy way to enable NVIDIA web driver, removed in 10.12)\n– npci=0x2000 (legacy, disables kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64)\n– lapic_dont_panic=1\n– slide=VALUE (manually set KASLR slide)\n– smcdebug=VALUE (AppleSMC debug mask)\n– -amd_no_dgpu_accel (alternative to WhateverGreen’s -radvesa for new GPUs)\n– -nehalem_error_disable\n– -no_compat_check (disable model checking on 10.7+)\n– -s (single mode)\n– -v (verbose mode)\n– -x (safe mode)\nThere are multiple external places summarising macOS argument lists: example 1, example 2.\n• 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:bootercfg\nBooter arguments, similar to boot-args but for boot.efi. Accepts a set of arguments, which are hexadecimal 64-bit values with or without 0x. At different stages boot.efi will request different debugging (logging) modes (e.g. after ExitBootServices it will only print to serial). Several booter arguments control whether these requests\nwill succeed. The list of known requests is covered below: – 0x00 – INIT.\n– 0x01 – VERBOSE (e.g. -v, force console logging).\n– 0x02 – EXIT.\n– 0x03 – RESET:OK.\n– 0x04 – RESET:FAIL (e.g. unknown board-id, hibernate mismatch, panic loop, etc.). – 0x05 – RESET:RECOVERY.\n– 0x06 – RECOVERY.\n– 0x07 – REAN:START.\n– 0x08 – REAN:END.\n– 0x09 – DT (can no longer log to DeviceTree).\n– 0x0A – EXITBS:START (forced serial only).\n– 0x0B – EXITBS:END (forced serial only).\n– 0x0C – UNKNOWN.\nIn 10.15 debugging support was mostly broken before 10.15.4 due to some kind of refactoring and introduction of a new debug protocol. Some of the arguments and their values below may not be valid for versions prior to 10.15.4. The list of known arguments is covered below:\n– boot-save-log=VALUE — debug log save mode for normal boot.\n∗ 0\n∗ 1\n∗ 2 — (default).\n∗ 3\n∗ 4 — (save to file).\n– wake-save-log=VALUE — debug log save mode for hibernation wake.\n∗ 0 — disabled.\n∗ 1\n∗ 2 — (default).\n∗ 3 — (unavailable).\n∗ 4 — (save to file, unavailable).\n– breakpoint=VALUE — enables debug breaks (missing in production boot.efi).\n∗ 0 — disables debug breaks on errors (default).\n∗ 1 — enables debug breaks on errors.\n– console=VALUE — enables console logging.\n∗ 0 — disables console logging.\n∗ 1 — enables console logging when debug protocol is missing (default).\n∗ 2 — enables console logging unconditionally (unavailable).\n– embed-log-dt=VALUE — enables DeviceTree logging.\n∗ 0 — disables DeviceTree logging (default).\n∗ 1 — enables DeviceTree logging.\n– kc-read-size=VALUE — Chunk size used for buffered I/O from network or disk for prelinkedkernel reading and related. Set to 1MB (0x100000) by default, can be tuned for faster booting.\n– log-level=VALUE — log level bitmask.\n∗ 0x01 — enables trace logging (default).\n– serial=VALUE — enables serial logging.\n∗ 0 — disables serial logging (default).\n∗ 1 — enables serial logging for EXITBS:END onwards.\n∗ 2 — enables serial logging for EXITBS:START onwards.\n∗ 3 — enables serial logging when debug protocol is missing.\n∗ 4 — enables serial logging unconditionally.\n– timestamps=VALUE — enables timestamp logging.\n∗ 0 — disables timestamp logging.\n∗ 1 — enables timestamp logging (default).\n– log=VALUE — deprecated starting from 10.15.\n∗ 1 — AppleLoggingConOutOrErrSet/AppleLoggingConOutOrErrPrint (classical ConOut/StdErr)\n∗ 2 — AppleLoggingStdErrSet/AppleLoggingStdErrPrint (StdErr or serial?)\n∗ 4 — AppleLoggingFileSet/AppleLoggingFilePrint (BOOTER.LOG/BOOTER.OLD file on EFI partition) – debug=VALUE — deprecated starting from 10.15.\n∗ 1 — enables print something to BOOTER.LOG (stripped code implies there may be a crash)\n∗ 2 — enables perf logging to /efi/debug-log in the device three\n∗ 4 — enables timestamp printing for styled printf calls\n– level=VALUE — deprecated starting from 10.15. Verbosity level of DEBUG output. Everything but 0x80000000 is stripped from the binary, and this is the default value.\nNote: To see verbose output from boot.efi on modern macOS versions enable AppleDebug option. This will save the log to general OpenCore log. For versions before 10.15.4 set bootercfg to log=1. This will print verbose output onscreen.\n• 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:bootercfg-once\nBooter arguments override removed after first launch. Otherwise equivalent to bootercfg.\n• 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:efiboot-perf-record\nEnable performance log saving in boot.efi. Performance log is saved to physical memory and is pointed by efiboot-perf-record-data and efiboot-perf-record-size variables. Starting from 10.15.4 it can also be saved to OpenCore log by AppleDebug option.\n• 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:fmm-computer-name Current saved host name. ASCII string.\n• 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:nvda_drv\nNVIDIA Web Driver control variable. Takes ASCII digit 1 or 0 to enable or disable installed driver.\n• 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:run-efi-updater \nOverride EFI firmware updating support in macOS (MultiUpdater, ThorUtil, and so on). Setting this to No or alternative boolean-castable value will prevent any firmware updates in macOS starting with 10.10 at least.\n• 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:StartupMute\nMute startup chime sound in firmware audio support. 8-bit integer. The value of 0x00 means unmuted. Missing variable or any other value means muted. This variable only affects Gibraltar machines (T2).\n• 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:SystemAudioVolume\nSystem audio volume level for firmware audio support. 8-bit integer. The bit of 0x80 means muted. Lower bits are used to encode volume range specific to installed audio codec. The value is capped by MaximumBootBeepVolume AppleHDA layout value to avoid too loud audio playback in the firmware.";
